# pooling_capacity_simulation
Monte carlo simulation for pooling optimization performance on historical surveillance data to determine relative performance in test conservation. Discrete event simulation uses resulting test count to simulate varying laboratory capacity levels on processing time in daily, outbreak, and large scale surveillance scenarios.
